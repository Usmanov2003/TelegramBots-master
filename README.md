Contributions
Feel free to fork this project, work on it and then make a pull request against DEV branch. Most of the times I will accept them if they add something valuable to the code.

Please, DO NOT PUSH ANY TOKEN OR API KEY, I will never accept a pull request with that content.

Webhooks vs GetUpdates
Both ways are supported, but I recommend long polling method.
